# Isolation Station Interactive Website

Isolation Station is an internet radio station, with over 35,000 total listens on mixlr.com.

In this project, I created both a web and mobile website to provide a base for the station, with
access to a virtual space in which the listener can tune in to the station, and engage with the 
broadcasters.
